# ReadableArduinoRobotTemplate
An Arduino robot code template based on CREATE Open Powered by NPPD competition robots

The purpose of this code is to act as a template for robots using Arduino-based code in 
the CREATE Open robotics league.  Hopefully, this will lower the barrier to getting a 
working robot with something other than the VEX hardware.

Most code to date is either too simple to be useful or spaghetti code written by students 
that is difficult to teach from.  This code strives to be different by providing solid 
structure, adequate comments, and simple troubleshooting!

This code is based off of other robots in previous years of the CREATE Open.  It assumes 
some specific hardware, but is also written in a modular fashion so that can be replaced.

Happy coding!
